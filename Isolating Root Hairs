Plant the seeds in germination paper (Cigar rolls) or petri plates lined with filter paper. Let them grow for a week.
Fill a mortar/suitable container with liquid nitrogen. Add roots separated from seedlings.
Gently stir the roots in LN2 with a glass rod until the root are broken into big chunks.
Put a metal strainer on a falcon tube or another container. Pour the contents of the mortar into it along with liquid nitrogen.
Add more LN2 into the mortar with stripped roots and filter it through the strainer/sieve.
Repeat this step to retrieve as much root hairs as possible.
Let LN2 evaporate from the falcon tube. Store the isolated root hairs at -80Â° C.
